This document is the API specification for Callisto, a configurable
annotation tool. It currently only annotates text files, storing
annotations in AIF format.  Support is available for SGML
importing/exporting on a task by task basis.  Audio and Video which
has been converted to an aif file with Speech to Text annotations is
also among our goals.<p>

<h1>Annotators</h1>

Annotators are encouraged to look to the user documentation.
Hopefully there will be documentation for the task you are working on,
as the tool is rather configurable, and each may look and behave in a
significantly different manner.<p>

There was documentation made for the RDC task, and for lack of more
specific task documentation, that is a good place to start.  If all
fails, you should feel free to read through the javadoc here, but be
warned that it is intended for developers wishing to maintain and
extend the tool.<p>

<h1>Developers</h1>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

Developers wishing to create a new task to the project should start by
reading javadoc. So far, much effort has been put in during
development, to include the important details. Hopefully by the time
this is an issue, there will be some generic tools for building
tasks.<p>

Start with the {@link org.mitre.jawb.tasks.Task} class and get a feel
for what it does. It controls the behavior of the whole tool,
dictating annotation structure, GUI components, and some user
preferences. For annotation structure, it makes use of the classes in
the {@link org.mitre.jawb.atlas} package, and for GUI components look
at the {@link org.mitre.jawb.gui} package.  There are also some
generic GUI components in {@link org.mitre.jawb.swing} which may be
used independantly of any Annotation tool code.<p>

To load use your task, Callisto needs to find it! For information on how
it locates and loads tasks at startup, see the initialization methods
in {@link org.mitre.jawb.Jawb}<p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

The "main" method for starting the tool is found in {@link
org.mitre.jawb.Jawb} which initializes Preferences (default, system
and user prefs), loads and verifies tasks, and acts as a central 'hub'
for this global data. The Jawb class also provides some convience
methods for accessing system wide resources.<p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

Preferences are initialized in the Jawb class. Look at the
initialization methods there for more information on the what files
are used, which <font size='-1'>TODO: better link</font><p>

<h3>Frames</h3>

Frames primarily worry about themselves.  There is a static list of
frames that is maintained and shares a {@link
org.mitre.jawb.gui.DocumentManager} which maintains the list of currently
open documents and a history. DocumentManager has hooks for Frames to
get Menus to display the current documents and history.<p>

Closing of windows and documents is handled within the frames in such
a way that no document is closed until that request is explicitly made
or the last frame is closed.  Even then the user may abort if there
are unsaved files. See the open, close, save, closeFrame, openFrame
methods in {@link org.mitre.jawb.gui.JawbFrame}<p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

Error handling for the various actions is also in the Frames, and will
fail silently or display a warning or error message to the user as
appropriate. Classes should allow unchecked exceptions (subclasses of
{@link java.lang.RuntimeException} to propogate up to the JawbFrame
which pretty much catches everything and coninues gracefully. Unless
the Exception can be handled, and recovered from, at a lower level, do
not catch it, and verify that it is caught in the GUI, where the user
action which caused it was invoked.<p>

The GUI does not attempt to catch all {@link java.lang.Throwable}
objects, only {@link java.lang.Exception} subclasses, since Throwable
is intended to imply an unrecoverable system error.<p>

<h3>Model-Control-View</h3>

One of the strengths of Callisto is that it maintains a strong
separation between the data in the 'model' and what is displayed and
maintained by individual widgets. In this way, no one gui component is
responsible for maintaining data that others may need. For a more in
depth discussion of the design pattern, see <a
href="http://java.sun.com/">SUN's website</a>.

The basic Model is the {@link org.mitre.jawb.gui.JawbDocument} object,
which is the front end to all the data shared between GUI components.
View Components should implement the {@link
org.mitre.jawb.gui.JawbComponent} interface, which allows the
JawbDocument to be set and retrieved. Control is done through the
actions retrieved from the Task, and the Components that the task
provides, which are ostensibly views as well, but presumably provide a
measure of control and editing functionality.<p>

page?  I suspect it is... pare this down, and put something more of an
index up</font>
