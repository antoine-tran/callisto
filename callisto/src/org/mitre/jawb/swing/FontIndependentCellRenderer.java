/**
 * A class for rendering (displaying) individual cells in a
 * <code>JTable</code> with a specified font. All columns, and cells using
 * this renderer, will use the font specified. Default is to use the font of
 * the table itself. Manually setting the font to <code>null</code> will
 * revert to this default.<p>
 *
 * <strong><a name="override">Implementation Note:</a></strong> This class
 * inherits from <code>JLabel</code>, a standard component class.  However
 * <code>JTable</code> employs a unique mechanism for rendering its cells and
 * therefore requires some slightly modified behavior from its cell
 * renderer. The table class defines a single cell renderer and uses it as a
 * as a rubber-stamp for rendering all cells in the table; it renders the
 * first cell, changes the contents of that cell renderer, shifts the origin
 * to the new location, re-draws it, and so on.  The standard
 * <code>JLabel</code> component was not designed to be used this way and we
 * want to avoid triggering a <code>revalidate</code> each time the cell is
 * drawn. This would greatly decrease performance because the
 * <code>revalidate</code> message would be passed up the hierarchy of the
 * container to determine whether any other components would be affected.  So
 * this class overrides the <code>validate</code>, <code>revalidate</code>,
 * <code>repaint</code>, and <code>firePropertyChange</code> methods to be
 * no-ops.  If you write your own renderer, please keep this performance
 * consideration in mind.  <p>
 *
 * <strong>Warning:</strong>
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
 * has been added to the <code>java.beans</code> package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
