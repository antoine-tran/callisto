Version 1.2.0

Please read the README.txt file in the same directory as this file
before continuing. It contains more general project information. An
installer is distributed for Callisto to install prebuilt binaries on
your machine.  This file documents the process for building and
installing from source.

Binary distributeions of the Callisto code are available at
http://callisto.mitre.org/

You should be familiar with Java programming and the environment in
which you plan to use the code before moving forward. Sun Microsystems
has a great deal of documentation online at http://java.sun.com/

Note that while java works on many platforms, we have adopted the UNIX
style when discussing directory structures and environment variables:
please make the neccissary coversions for your platform.

There are a few dependent Java class libraries required to build the
Callisto.jar file and any Task jar files, but these have been included
in the distribution. Source code for them may be included in the
material you recieved, or you can download them online from their
respective web sites.

The binary Callisto jar files, and included tasks can easily be built
using the java build tool "ant".  You can find ant files, installation
instructions and documentation at http://ant.apache.org/

After unpacking this release run ant with the target 'build'.

$ cd $CALLISTO_HOME
$ ant build

This will compile the Callisto source, and create the Callisto.jar
file, and included task files in the $CALLISTO_HOME/build directory. A
copy of the neccissary third-party libraries are copied in as well so
that you may run Callisto directly from there.

Other ant targets of interst:

$ ant -projecthelp
Buildfile: build.xml
Main targets:

 build    Create jar file in 'build' and copy third-party jars as well.
 compile  Compile class files into 'classes'.
 dist     Build all distribution jar files, including tasks.
 javadoc  Creates javadoc in 'docs/apidocs'
 run      Run Callisto from the compiled .class files.
 runjar   Run Callisto from the jar file.
 src      Create a tarball of the source tree

Default target: build
